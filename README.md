# Lender

This is a simple REST API that allows users to lend and borrow media in their region. It's mainly for educational/training purposes, since this would require a full stack. Maybe I'll add a front end at some point, but for actual use it's pretty pointless, since it would require infrastructure and users. To my knowledge, there has been a similar project which failed/never got their tracks on. I guess one problem is that most people use ebay for this kind of thing anyway. As I said, this is mainly for training/fun!

## Installation

It comes with a `Makefile`, you will need to have at least `cargo` and `rustc` installed.
